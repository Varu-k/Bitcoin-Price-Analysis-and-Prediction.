Bitcoin Price Analysis and Prediction

This project provides a simple workflow for downloading, analyzing, visualizing, and modeling historical Bitcoin price data using Python. It leverages the `yfinance` library to fetch data, `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for visualization, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning.

Features

- Downloads historical Bitcoin (BTC-USD) data and saves it as `btc.csv`
- Cleans and preprocesses the data
- Visualizes Bitcoin's closing and opening prices over time
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Sets up a Random Forest Classifier for price prediction (example code provided)

Project Structure

- `bitcoin_working.ipyb.ipynb` &mdash; Main Jupyter notebook with all code and analysis
- `btc.csv` &mdash; CSV file containing historical Bitcoin data

 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension

 Python Packages

- yfinance
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install all dependencies with:

```sh
pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

 Usage

1. **Open the notebook**  
   Open `bitcoin_working.ipyb.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

2. **Run all cells**  
   The notebook will:
   - Download Bitcoin price data
   - Save it to `btc.csv`
   - Clean and preprocess the data
   - Plot closing and opening prices
   - Prepare data for machine learning

Model Training

The notebook demonstrates how to split the data and set up a Random Forest Classifier. Example code for fitting the model is provided but commented out.

## Example Visualizations

- Line plot of Bitcoin closing price over time
- Line plot of Bitcoin opening price over time

Customization

- You can modify the predictors and target variable in the model section to experiment with different features.
- Additional visualizations and analyses can be added as needed.
